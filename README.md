# Drum Kit Website

## Introduction

Hello, fellow developers! I'm excited to share my latest project with you: a **Drum Kit**. This project is a fun and interactive way to practice JavaScript, especially in handling user inputs and audio playback. Whether you're a beginner looking to dive into JavaScript or someone who loves music and coding, this project is perfect for you.

## Project Overview

The **Drum Kit** is an interactive web application that simulates a drum set. Users can play sounds by clicking on the drum buttons or pressing corresponding keys on their keyboard. The project demonstrates how to work with events, audio, and CSS animations to create a responsive and engaging user experience.

## Features

- **Interactive Drum Buttons**: Clickable buttons that play different drum sounds.
- **Keyboard Controls**: Press specific keys to trigger drum sounds.
- **Visual Feedback**: Buttons animate when pressed, providing immediate visual feedback.
- **Responsive Design**: The layout adjusts to different screen sizes, ensuring a consistent experience across devices.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Provides the structure of the drum kit interface.
- **CSS**: Styles the drum kit, including the button animations and overall layout.
- **JavaScript**: Handles user interactions, sound playback, and animations.


## Installation

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/abhishekgurjarin/Drum-Kit.git
    ```

2. **Open the project directory**:
    ```bash
    cd Drum-Kit
    ```

3. **Run the project**:
    - Open the `index.html` file in a web browser to see the drum kit in action.

## Usage

1. **Open the website** in a web browser.
2. **Click the drum buttons** or **press the corresponding keys** (`w`, `a`, `s`, `d`, `j`, `k`, `l`) to play different drum sounds.
